- Double-click the executable file to begin installation.
- Follow the instructions to install the component.
- You may need to restart your computer for environment variable changes
  to take effect before using the component.

The component can be launched by double-clicking the
``RTC_Spider2020_Crawler_PreviewComp`` executable. The ``RTC_Spider2020_Crawler_Preview`` library
is available for loading into a manager, using the initialisation function
``RTC_Spider2020_Crawler_PreviewInit``.

From source
-----------

Follow these steps to install RTC_Spider2020_Crawler_Preview from source in any operating
system:

- Download the source, either from the repository or a source archive,
  and extract it somewhere::

    tar -xvzf RTC_Spider2020_Crawler_Preview-1.0.0.tar.gz

- Change to the directory containing the extracted source::

    cd RTC_Spider2020_Crawler_Preview-1.0.0

- Create a directory called ``build``::

    mkdir build

- Change to that directory::

    cd build

- Run cmake or cmake-gui::

    cmake ../

- If no errors occurred, run make::

    make

- Finally, install the component. Ensure the necessary permissions to
  install into the chosen prefix are available::

    make install

- The install destination can be changed by executing ccmake and changing
  the variable ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``::

    ccmake ../

The component is now ready for use. See the next section for instructions on
configuring the component.

RTC_Spider2020_Crawler_Preview can be launched in stand-alone mode by executing the
``RTC_Spider2020_Crawler_PreviewComp`` executable (installed into ``${prefix}/components/bin``).
Alternatively, ``libRTC_Spider2020_Crawler_Preview.so`` can be loaded into a manager, using the
initialisation function ``RTC_Spider2020_Crawler_PreviewInit``. This shared object can be found in
``${prefix}/components/lib`` or ``${prefix}/components/lib64``.
